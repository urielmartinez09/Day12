    "### Web Scraping Ethical Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some things to be aware of before you start scraping data from the web. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Some data is private or protected. Just because you have access to a websites data doesn't mean you are allowed to scrape it. For example, when you log into Facebook or another social media site, you are granted special access to data about your connected people. It is unethical to use that access to scrape their private data!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some websites have rules against scraping and will cut of service to users who are clearly scraping data. How do they know? Webscrapers access the website very differently that regular users. If they site has a policy about scraping data then you should follow it and/or content them about getting the data if you have a true academic interest in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The line between web scraping and plagiarism can be very blurry. Make sure that you are citing where your data comes from AND not just reproducing the data exactly. Always citing the source of your data and make sure you are doing something new with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ethics are different depending on if you are using the data for a personal project (eg. you just want to check scores for your favorite team daily and print the stuff you care about) vs if you are using the project for your business or website (eg. publishing information to drive clicks to your site/video/account or making money from the data you collect). In the later case it is EXTRA important to respect the original owner of the data. Drive web traffic back to their site, check with them about using their data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Ethical Scraper** (from https://towardsdatascience.com/ethics-in-web-scraping-b96b18136f01):\n",
    "\n",
    "I, the web scraper will live by the following principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have a public API that provides the data I’m looking for, I’ll use it and avoid scraping all together.\n",
    "- I will always provide a User Agent string that makes my intentions clear and provides a way for you to contact me with questions or concerns.\n",
    "- I will request data at a reasonable rate. I will strive to never be confused for a DDoS attack.\n",
    "- I will only save the data I absolutely need from your page. If all I need it OpenGraph meta-data, that’s all I’ll keep.\n",
    "- I will respect any content I do keep. I’ll never pass it off as my own.\n",
    "- I will look for ways to return value to you. Maybe I can drive some (real) traffic to your site or credit you in an article or post.\n",
    "- I will respond in a timely fashion to your outreach and work with you towards a resolution.\n",
    "- I will scrape for the purpose of creating new value from the data, not to duplicate it."
